            <p class="firstParagraph">Halloween is here again. That means your co-workers have planted
                surprise spiders around the office. You’ve been invited to a haunted hayride. Your
                neighbor’s yard has a full cemetery, rigged with motion detectors and pop-up zombies.
                Chicken-livered from the start, I have always dreaded this time of year. Haunted houses,
                ghost tours and horror film fests are not my thing, and why people love having the
                daylights scared out of them completely escapes me.</p>
            <p>I decided to try to understand my friends who are on the lookout for thrills this time of
                year. As it turns out, there are many possible reasons some people like to be scared stiff.
                Each person’s threshold for experiences that provoke fear is made up of a unique recipe
                that blends nature and nurture. <q>The ingredients vary from person to person,</q> said Frank
                Farley, a psychologist at Temple University and a former president of the American
                Psychological Association.</p>
            <p>Dr. Farley is interested in what draws certain people to extreme behaviors, like driving
                racecars, climbing Mount Everest and flying hot air balloons across oceans. In the 1980s,
                he coined the term <q>Type T</q> personality to refer to the behavioral profile of
                thrill-seekers. What makes someone thrill-seeking, he said, comes down to a mix of genes,
                environment and early development.</p>
            <p>David Zald, a neuropsychologist at Vanderbilt University, studies one piece of the equation.
                His research partly focuses on dopamine, a chemical involved in our brain’s response to
                reward. In the past, he has found that people who lack what he calls “brakes” on dopamine
                release tend to pursue thrilling activities.</p>
            <p>When you go to a haunted house, you’re grappling with a conflict, Dr. Zald said:<q>The
                experience could either be fun or terrifying, and how you weigh that balance could depend
                in part on dopamine levels.</q> <q>Having a greater amount of dopamine pushes someone to
                pursue the goal of excitement,</q> he said, <q>whereas someone who basically has less
                dopamine is more likely to hold back and say, ‘No, this isn’t worth it to me.’</q></p>
            <p>
                Socially, we get cues about how to respond to fear from those around us, said Margee Kerr,
                a sociologist and author of the book “Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear.”
                Early on, that’s taking notes from our parents about how to deal with distress. Later,
                experiencing stressful situations with others can cultivate social bonds.
            </p>
            <p>Part of that has to do with emotional contagion, or a communal response to shared
                experiences, Dr. Kerr said. If your friend is captivated by the horror movie you are
                watching together, you process that by recreating the same feeling in your own mind, and
                that can bring you closer together. People also tend to hold onto memories of fear more
                intensely, she said, so if you have positive associations with a scary situation, like
                going to a haunted house, you’ll likely want to do it again.</p>
            <p>Fear-seeking can also be a way of testing oneself. Josh Randall and Kristjan Thor, creators
                of Blackout, a haunted house experience that consistently tops rankings of “Most Extreme
                Haunted Houses,” said they see many people coming to their events with a goal of
                self-fortification. “It’s almost like a dare to themselves,” Mr. Thor said. “People want to
                be able to conquer something.”</p>
            <p>For many, being scared is a jolting escape from daily life. When immersed in a scary
                situation, you can suspend your disbelief and live in the moment — and that loss of control
                can feel really good. This is key for Blackout, Mr. Randall said: <blockquote>For a finite
            period of time, that audience member can turn off the real world, and live in a fantasy world
            .</blockquote>
            <p>After talking with the experts, I was starting to see why some friends love getting spooked.
                But why do I hate being scared so much?</p>
            <p>It could be because I was never exposed to horror movies or haunted houses growing up, so by
                the time I did experience these things, I was ill-prepared. It could be that the regions in
                my  brain involved in coding fear and anxiety are more sensitive. Most likely, it is a mix
                of many different factors. Regardless of the reason though, <q>it’s perfectly O.K. not to
                    like scary things,</q> Dr. Kerr said.</p>
            <p>For people who cannot fathom sitting out a haunted house, it’s important not to coerce your
                more cautious friends into doing something they do not want to, Dr. Kerr said. “That can
                compound the fear, and make it even worse.” So, for any friends who were thinking of
                inviting me to the haunted house this weekend, save your breath — I have a doctor’s note.</p>

                <header>Facebook Can Tell You What to Expect in the Voting Booth</header>
                <p class="firstParagraph">Facebook is using its enormous reach to get out the informed vote
                    on Election Day.</p>
                <p>The social media giant has created a vote planner tool that shows users what candidates and
                    issues will be on their ballots on Nov. 8, including local, state and national choices
                    .</p>
                <p>The tool was created with data collected from election officials by the nonpartisan
                    research group Center for Technology and Civic Life. It also shows where each candidate
                    stands on major issues.</p>
                <p>“We wanted to help people prepare for the election and make it as easy as possible to
                    prepare,” said Jeremy Galen, a product marketing manager at Facebook.</p>
                <p>According to Facebook, only about 20 states mail out samples before an election, making it
                    hard for voters to be truly informed before they make their choices.</p>
                <p>The company has also made it possible for users to share their choices with friends because
                    <q>many people look to friends and family for information and guidance about how to
                        vote,</q>Mr. Galen said.</p>
                <p>But Facebook also realized that voting is a private matter for most people. While the
                    company generally encourages people to make public the information they post to the
                    platform, people must opt in to make their vote planner information visible to friends who
                    have also used the tool.</p>
                <p>Facebook began working on the tool six months ago as part of its work to promote civic
                    engagement.</p>
                <p>The company has sent out Election Day reminders since 2008, and it sends such notifications
                    in 47 countries. In January, it introduced a voter registration reminder to coincide with
                    the United States presidential primaries and it ran live broadcasts of this year’s
                    presidential debates.</p>
                <p>Users can also save and print out their choices and bring them to the ballot box, where
                    phones are generally prohibited.</p>

                <header>After You Strengthen Your Passwords, Here’s How to Store Them</header>
                <p class="firstParagraph">THE recent revelation that the account information of at least 500
                    million Yahoo users
                    was stolen in 2014 was a big reminder that we all need to be smarter about our digital
                    security. That includes our smartphones, which are increasingly the repositories for
                    all sorts of information about our digital lives.</p>
                <p>Turning our smartphones into personal data fortresses requires the use of strong
                    passwords — and never using the same password for different services. Fortunately,
                    there are plenty of apps that can help you remember all those passwords.</p>
                <p>Dashlane, which is free to download for iOS and Android devices, is an excellent secure
                    password system. The app, which is essentially a digital strongbox for all your online
                    keys, has just one master password to remember. After you enter that password (which
                    should be very strong), you have access to all your other passwords inside the app.</p>
                <p>This means people can move beyond using easy-to-remember passwords like “123456” and use
                    longer, more complex passwords that are more difficult for hackers to crack. To help,
                    Dashlane has a password generator that users can customize, for instance by varying the
                    length of passwords or specifying whether they should include nonletter symbols.</p>
                <p>Dashlane can automatically update passwords, a feature that is compatible with many
                    websites including IFTTT and Kickstarter. You can also create your own passwords, and
                    Dashlane will analyze how hacker-resistant they are and flag any passwords that have
                    already been used elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Dashlane has a built-in browser that is designed to be secure, so people can shop or
                    bank online with fewer worries about having their information compromised. It also
                    allows users to securely share passwords with others — a useful feature for anyone with
                    shared accounts.</p>
                <p>An upgraded version, which costs $40 a year, provides extras like cloud-based backup of
                    your password information and secure sharing of passwords between different devices.</p>

                    <figcaption>Strange picture from TheNYTimes</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="firstParagraph">Going on a group trip for your next vacation is a way to meet
                    like-minded travelers and
                    get
                    more from your money, according to Heidi Podjavorsek, the vice president for sales and
                    marketing at the Signature Travel Network and a specialist in group vacations.
                <blockquote>"Since the others on your trip are interested in the itinerary, you’re with
                    people who share a common interest,” she said, “and the cost of the trip usually covers
                    some meals, tours of popular attractions and other inclusions, which add up to a big money
                    savings.”</blockquote>
                <p>There are hundreds of options when it comes to picking a group trip. Here, Ms. Podjavorsek
                    shares her advice on finding the best one for you.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><div>MATCH A TRIP TO YOUR STYLE All</div> group trips to the same destination aren’t
                        created equal, and it’s important to book one based on your priorities — some are
                        activity-based, while others focus on culture, gastronomy or luxury accommodations.
                        If you’re interested in Tuscan wine, for example, Butterfield &amp; Robinson and
                        Backroads offer bike tours of Tuscany, while the itineraries for the region from
                        Abercrombie &amp; Kent include access to some prestigious wineries and high-end
                        meals.Trips from Globus and Trafalgar visit more wineries that are less exclusive;
                        these trips also cost less.</li>
                    <li><div>
                        IS FLEXIBILITY IMPORTANT?</div> Some group trips, according to Ms. Podjavorsek, have
                        itineraries with activities from morning through dinner and are ideal for travelers
                        who want little free time. Others, such as those from G Adventures and Insight
                        Vacations, allow for more flexibility — they may include only a half-day of
                        activity while the rest of the day is left open for exploring on your own. Decide
                        which appeals to you more.</li>
                    <li><div>THE CASE FOR A SMALLER GROUP </div>Generally, a group trip shouldn’t have more
                        than 16 people, Ms. Podjavorsek said. <q>Everything takes longer when you have more
                            people, including hotel check-in and meals,</q> she said. Also, larger groups
                        rely on buses for transportation, which are too big to get into the city centers of
                        many small towns, especially in Europe. But a benefit of traveling with a larger group
                        is the price — these trips are usually less expensive than their smaller
                        counterparts.</li>
                    <li><div>AGE AND DIVERSITY</div> If you want to travel with people in your age range,
                        pick a trip accordingly. Companies that tend to attract travelers older than 50
                        include Insight Vacations, Globus and Natural Habitat Adventures. Younger travelers
                        are drawn to G Adventures, Contiki Tours and Cosmos. If you want to travel with
                        people from countries besides the United States, trips from Trafalgar, Insight
                        Vacations and Abercrombie &amp; Kent attract travelers from around the world.</li>
                    <li><div>IS IT FAMILY-FRIENDLY?</div> Many group trips aren’t ideal if you’re traveling
                        with young children or teenagers, while some are meant specifically for families.
                        Adventures by Disney, Backroads, Butterfield &amp; Robinson, Tauck Bridges,
                        Trafalgar and Cox &amp; Kings offer high-quality family-friendly group trips.</li>
                </ul>
